Detailed Description of game 

    This game is modeled after Undertale, and indie RPG where your choices 
influence the ending of the game. Other rooms can be accessed by walking against
any blue wall in a room. if the wall is not blue, there is no room on the other
side. In our game, you will need to go to each of the red squares to start a battle. Once in a battle, you can use the arrow keys 
to select from the button options. (press Z to select)
    -all movement is controlled with arrow keys
    -all selections are made with "z"
    -no enemy triggers will render initially in the first room
    -combat is TURN BASED, meaning that upon selecting an option it will become the enemy's turn
        -when the enemy's turn is active, use the arrow keys to control the cowboy hat icon
        -touching the boxes will lead to HP loss
        -when your HP is zero, something bad happens
    -An enemy can be beaten through FIGHTing until they are out of HP, or through ACTing until their mercy bar is full. 
    -use the ITEM button to recover HP, at the cost of your turn
    -Once an enemy's mercy bar is full, they can be spared and their square will turn blue. 
    -Red "enemy trigger" boxes are joined across all rooms, so all 10 can be done in the same room if you so choose.

what problems did you encounter as you created the program?

    -Getting images to show up and render properly
    -Making attacks seem fair, not to easy or hard
    -implementing a system to travel in between rooms

what features were you NOT able to implement in your program and why?

    -We were not able to implement a variety of enemies, mainly
    due to time constraints. Code still exists to handle multiple possible
    enemies, but this was never implemented
    -We were not able to create an OST for the game, because of time constraints
    -We wannted to include some text for the enemy to say but decided not to as it 
    did not seem like it would fit the gamer anymore. Code still exists for this with
    placeholding texts that were used for testing

short reflection of what you learned in creating this assignment

    In creating this assignment, we were able to learn image renderng and 
audio rendering in greater depth, as well as using custom pictures and hitboxes for
attacks/rooms/characters.
